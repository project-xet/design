# Xet

This is a speculative web-framework written in Swift. Speculative, because at this point it only consists of a proposal and some prototype code.

This repository is a set of documents which describe various ideas for the design for Xet. It's not a specification. Instead it's more informal; a whitepaper of sorts.

It's broken down into the following sections:

1. [Why Another Framework?](doc/1-why.md)
2. [Goals](doc/2-goals.md)
3. [High Level Design](3-design.md)
4. [Implementation](4-implementation.md)
